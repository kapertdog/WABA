## Base
- [ ] Info API
  - helps with version tracking, 
- [ ] Settings API
- [ ] Multi Language Text API
- [ ] Flows / Instructions API
- [ ] Sensors API

  their own UI Library e.t.g, it's just about 
  "put this button in this option menu")
- [ ] Plugin API
- [ ] GitHub Actions Building

## Cleanup
- [ ] Comments
  - [ ] Translate all russian to readable English

## Features
- [ ] Files protection 
(suggested by [@example](https://github.com/example))
  - should check and report if plugins / inner files have any 
not intentional changes or corruption. Probably by creating 
entire tree of filenames and their checksums (including folders)
